* World Neighborhood/Telecomix VPN access Bash scripts *

This directory contains a set of scripts that are usable on Linux to connect to
some of the WNh VPN endpoints. With some adjustments, they can serve as
examples to connect to other VPN servers with different configuration. For all
of them, one has to know at least an IP and port to connect to.

Several scripts are included, each leading to establish a VPN connection
through a different vector. They require a bunch of commands to be available:

- grep, awk, sed, echo, cut, cat
- sha1sum
- ip (iproute2 package)
- iptables, ip6tables
- ping
- uuidgen
- date, sleep
